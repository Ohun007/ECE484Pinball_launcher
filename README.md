# ECE484Pinball_launcher

This repository will hold the code for our ECE484 Pinball machine's launch control, using an electromagnetic launcher, controlled by a button for a single ball and by Arduino to add multiple balls.
The launcher's button will charge the capacitor to determine launch power when launched by the player. The Arduino will fire at set power when multi-ball mode is activated. 
The ball will be moved into the rails or coil by a server controlled by the Arduino. Depending on development, there will be a feed mechanism for multiple balls to be launched in a single game.
